Projects
======
* An Inventory Model Application with Periodic Review for the Manufacture of Distribution Transformers
  * The project aims at designing and fabrication of two Buckling Restrained Braces which were analyzed
under dynamic loading. As alternative for conventional braces, these BRBs are also beneficial for seismic retro-fitting in RCC and steel structures.

* Business Game Theory Applied to Social Network
  * Presented a Seminar on Indirect Model Analysis, explaining the method to compute response of Prototype from the Influence lines obtained from Model. Use of Muller Breslau Principle in Indirect Model
Analysis and the Similitude between prototype and model.

* by using Time Series Analysis
  * Presented a seminar on Micro Tunneling, explaining its advantages over conventional method of drainage
laying systems. Analysis considering direct and indirect cost of micro tunneling was also discussed.


Skills
======
* C++, Python, MATLAB
* R, SAS, SPSS
* Spanish, English, Chinese
