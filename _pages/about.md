ABOUT ME
======
\[[Chen Qian's Resume](https:/ChenQian/files/CV.pdf)\]

BIBLIOGRAPHY
======
Hi, I am actively applying for doctoral programs in Statistics, Data science, and Computational Science & Engineering for Fall 2023. Overall, my research interest includes but not limited to:
*  Time series Analysis
*  Machine Learning (RNN, LSTM), Deep Learning
*  Stochastic Process
*  Bootstrapping
*  Computational Statistics

I am a graduate in Applied Statistics at [Complutense University of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/english)(graduated in 2020), where I am fortunate to work with [Enrique Gonzalez Aranguena](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=dQ10NgMAAAAJ&hl=es) on Time Series. *I will finish my M.S programs in Statistics at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in Spring 2023.*


I've also spent time at 

* Graduate independent Researcher.(working with [Xiucai Ding](https://xcding1212.github.io) on Non-stationary Time Series). R package 'Sie2nts' is available at [Sie2nts](https://xcding1212.github.io/software.html). A user's guide is available at [Guide](https://xcding1212.github.io/Sie2nts.html)

* Summer school at Complutense University of Madrid.(working with [Daniel Gomez Gonzalez](https://www.ucm.es/estadisticaycienciadatos/daniel-gomez-gonzalez-1) and [Conrado Miguel Manuel Garcia](http://worldcat.org/identities/np-manuel%20garcia,%20conrado%20miguel/) on Business Game Theory)

* Summer school at Complutense University of Madrid. (working with [Maria Isabel Riomoros Callejo](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=LXduvVYAAAAJ&hl=es) on Mathematics Workshop)

* Working at MPMF(A game technology company) in WuHan, China as data  Analyst. (working with [ChengJun Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chengjun-zhang-b3a450216/?trk=people-guest_people_search-card) on building A/B test and regression model for optimizing game products)
